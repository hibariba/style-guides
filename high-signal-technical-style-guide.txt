HIGH-SIGNAL TECHNICAL WRITING STYLE GUIDE (LLM DEFAULT)
-------------------------------------------------------


0) NORTH STAR
Maximize reader utility per word. Keep only decision-relevant, non-obvious
information. Delete everything else.


1) NORMATIVE KEYWORDS
Interpret these keywords exactly as in BCP 14:
MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY, REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED, OPTIONAL.

Rule: Only UPPERCASE carries normative meaning.


2) AUDIENCE ASSUMPTION
Default reader = competent engineer/researcher unfamiliar with this specific
artifact.
- Don’t teach basics they likely know.
- Define local terms, abbreviations, and project-specific jargon once.


3) INFORMATION POLICY (HIGH-ENTROPY RULE)
A sentence is allowed only if it does >= 1 of:
- Adds a new constraint, assumption, invariant, requirement, interface, or
  acceptance test
- Reduces meaningful uncertainty (numbers, bounds, evidence, confidence, failure
  modes)
- Changes a decision, priority, or next action
- Documents a non-goal (what we are explicitly not doing) that prevents wasted
  work

Hard deletions:
- Restating headings/titles
- Generic claims without measurable specifics ("robust", "simple", "best",
  "scalable", "important")
- Background not needed to interpret the decision/result
- Duplicates (same idea said twice)

If content is useful but not decision-critical:
- Move to an appendix, footnote, or link.


4) ORDERING (READER-FIRST)
Use an inverted-pyramid / BLUF structure:
- Lead with the conclusion/recommendation/result.
- Put details, rationale, and history later.

Default first section: TL;DR (3–6 bullets).


5) STRUCTURE (PICK THE RIGHT DOC TYPE)
Use Diátaxis categories to keep intent clean:
- Tutorial: learning path
- How-to: task completion steps
- Reference: precise facts/interfaces
- Explanation: concepts/why

Do not mix categories in one section. If needed, split.


6) STANDARD TEMPLATES

- DECISION / DESIGN DOC (DEFAULT)
  - TL;DR (result + decision + next step)
  - Problem (1 paragraph max)
  - Constraints & assumptions (bullets; quantify)
  - Proposal (what changes; interfaces)
  - Alternatives (2–4; why rejected)
  - Risks / failure modes / mitigations
  - Acceptance criteria (tests, metrics, rollout)
  - Open questions (ranked by impact)

- RESEARCH REPORT / EXPERIMENT NOTE
  - TL;DR (finding + implication + next step)
  - Setup (minimal; only what affects interpretation)
  - Method (enough to reproduce; link to code/data)
  - Results (tables/figures; key numbers)
  - Caveats (confounders, limitations)
  - Decision impact (what changes now)
  - Next experiments (smallest informative steps)

- SPEC / RFC
  - Abstract (what this enables; 3–5 lines)
  - Goals / Non-goals
  - Terms (only local definitions)
  - Requirements (MUST/SHOULD/MAY)
  - Interfaces (schemas, endpoints, contracts)
  - State machine / flows (if applicable)
  - Error handling & edge cases
  - Security / privacy / safety considerations
  - Test plan & acceptance criteria
  - Rollout / compatibility / migration

- README (REPO OR MODULE)
  - What it is (1–2 lines)
  - Quickstart (copy/paste)
  - API/usage examples
  - Config (only knobs that matter)
  - Operational notes (limits, costs, failure modes)
  - Links (full docs, ADRs, runbooks)


7) LANGUAGE RULES (CLARITY + COMPRESSION)
- Prefer short sentences; one idea per sentence.
- Prefer active voice and explicit actors ("Service A writes ...").
- Prefer concrete nouns/verbs over adjectives/adverbs.
- Quantify: latency, cost, memory, accuracy, sample size, confidence, error
  bars, bounds.
- Replace paragraphs with:
  - bullet lists for discrete points
  - tables for comparisons
  - math/notation for precision (only if it reduces ambiguity)
- Use consistent terminology; one name per concept.


8) FORMATTING RULES (MARKDOWN)
- Use headings to encode hierarchy; avoid deep nesting (>3).
- Bullets: parallel grammar; no full paragraphs inside bullets.
- Tables: when comparing >= 2 options across >= 3 dimensions.
- Code blocks: minimal, runnable, with expected output when helpful.
- Links: prefer canonical sources; don’t paste long URLs inline unless in
  References.


9) PRECISION VOCABULARY
Prefer:
- constraint, assumption, invariant, precondition, postcondition
- requirement, acceptance criterion, non-goal
- trade-off, risk, failure mode, edge case
- interface, contract, guarantee
- baseline, delta, metric, threshold, budget
- evidence, confidence, uncertainty

Avoid unless quantified:
- robust, simple, scalable, performant, optimal, best, easy, clearly, obviously,
  important


10) "SHOW THE DELTA" RULE
When proposing changes, always state:
- what changes (before/after)
- what stays the same
- why now (trigger)
- how we know it worked (acceptance criteria)


11) AGENT OUTPUT CONTRACT (FOR LLM TOOLS)
When generating or editing artifacts, the agent MUST:
- Start with TL;DR bullets (unless the doc is pure reference)
- Apply the High-Entropy Rule sentence-by-sentence
- Convert vague statements into measurable criteria or delete them
- Surface constraints, assumptions, trade-offs, and failure modes explicitly
- Produce a final "Diff Summary" of what was removed/added and why (1–8 bullets)

The agent MUST NOT:
- Add motivational filler, obvious background, or generic best practices
- Repeat the prompt or restate headings as content
- Introduce new terminology without defining it once


12) QUALITY GATES (PRE-SHIP CHECKLIST)
- TL;DR exists and matches the body
- Every section answers: "What decision/action does this enable?"
- Requirements are testable (objective pass/fail)
- Assumptions are explicit; unknowns are tracked
- Alternatives considered; rejection reasons recorded
- Risks include mitigations and detection signals
- No duplicate ideas; no vague adjectives without numbers
- Links to code/data/runbooks exist where relevant


13) SCORING RUBRIC (QUICK SELF-AUDIT)
Score 0–2 each:
- Signal density (no filler)
- Decision clarity (what to do, now)
- Testability (acceptance criteria)
- Explicit constraints/assumptions
- Failure modes covered
- Reproducibility (for research)
Target: >= 10/12 for publish; >= 8/12 for internal draft.


14) REFERENCES (CANONICAL)
- BCP 14: RFC 2119 + RFC 8174 (normative keywords)
- Google Technical Writing (clarity; active voice)
- Microsoft Writing Style Guide ("make every word count")
- NARA Plain Language Principles ("major points first", active voice, short
  sentences)
- Diátaxis framework (doc types: tutorial/how-to/reference/explanation)
- Purdue OWL (inverted pyramid concept)
