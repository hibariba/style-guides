Use when writing or editing technical documentation, design docs, RFCs, ADRs, research reports, READMEs, or any technical artifact where clarity and information density are critical. Enforces the High-Entropy Rule (keep only decision-relevant, non-obvious information), BLUF structure, normative keywords (BCP 14), precision vocabulary, and standard templates for common document types.

# High-Signal Technical Writing Style Guide

## North Star

Maximize reader utility per word. Keep only decision-relevant, non-obvious information. Delete everything else.

## Core Principles

### 1. High-Entropy Rule (Information Policy)

A sentence is allowed only if it does >= 1 of:
- Adds a new constraint, assumption, invariant, requirement, interface, or acceptance test
- Reduces meaningful uncertainty (numbers, bounds, evidence, confidence, failure modes)
- Changes a decision, priority, or next action
- Documents a non-goal (what we are explicitly not doing) that prevents wasted work

**Hard deletions:**
- Restating headings/titles
- Generic claims without measurable specifics ("robust", "simple", "best", "scalable", "important")
- Background not needed to interpret the decision/result
- Duplicates (same idea said twice)

**If content is useful but not decision-critical:** Move to an appendix, footnote, or link.

### 2. Normative Keywords (BCP 14)

Interpret these keywords exactly as in BCP 14 (RFC 2119 + RFC 8174):
- MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED
- SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED
- MAY, OPTIONAL

**Rule:** Only UPPERCASE carries normative meaning.

### 3. Audience Assumption

Default reader = competent engineer/researcher unfamiliar with this specific artifact.
- Don't teach basics they likely know
- Define local terms, abbreviations, and project-specific jargon once

### 4. Ordering (Reader-First)

Use inverted-pyramid / BLUF structure:
- Lead with the conclusion/recommendation/result
- Put details, rationale, and history later

**Default first section:** TL;DR (3–6 bullets)

### 5. "Show the Delta" Rule

When proposing changes, always state:
- what changes (before/after)
- what stays the same
- why now (trigger)
- how we know it worked (acceptance criteria)

## Standard Templates

### Decision / Design Doc (DEFAULT)

```
- TL;DR (result + decision + next step)
- Problem (1 paragraph max)
- Constraints & assumptions (bullets; quantify)
- Proposal (what changes; interfaces)
- Alternatives (2–4; why rejected)
- Risks / failure modes / mitigations
- Acceptance criteria (tests, metrics, rollout)
- Open questions (ranked by impact)
```

### Research Report / Experiment Note

```
- TL;DR (finding + implication + next step)
- Setup (minimal; only what affects interpretation)
- Method (enough to reproduce; link to code/data)
- Results (tables/figures; key numbers)
- Caveats (confounders, limitations)
- Decision impact (what changes now)
- Next experiments (smallest informative steps)
```

### Spec / RFC

```
- Abstract (what this enables; 3–5 lines)
- Goals / Non-goals
- Terms (only local definitions)
- Requirements (MUST/SHOULD/MAY)
- Interfaces (schemas, endpoints, contracts)
- State machine / flows (if applicable)
- Error handling & edge cases
- Security / privacy / safety considerations
- Test plan & acceptance criteria
- Rollout / compatibility / migration
```

### README (Repo or Module)

```
- What it is (1–2 lines)
- Quickstart (copy/paste)
- API/usage examples
- Config (only knobs that matter)
- Operational notes (limits, costs, failure modes)
- Links (full docs, ADRs, runbooks)
```

## Language Rules (Clarity + Compression)

- Prefer short sentences; one idea per sentence
- Prefer active voice and explicit actors ("Service A writes ...")
- Prefer concrete nouns/verbs over adjectives/adverbs
- Quantify: latency, cost, memory, accuracy, sample size, confidence, error bars, bounds
- Replace paragraphs with:
  - bullet lists for discrete points
  - tables for comparisons
  - math/notation for precision (only if it reduces ambiguity)
- Use consistent terminology; one name per concept

## Precision Vocabulary

**Prefer:**
- constraint, assumption, invariant, precondition, postcondition
- requirement, acceptance criterion, non-goal
- trade-off, risk, failure mode, edge case
- interface, contract, guarantee
- baseline, delta, metric, threshold, budget
- evidence, confidence, uncertainty

**Avoid unless quantified:**
- robust, simple, scalable, performant, optimal, best, easy, clearly, obviously, important

## Formatting Rules (Markdown)

- Use headings to encode hierarchy; avoid deep nesting (>3)
- Bullets: parallel grammar; no full paragraphs inside bullets
- Tables: when comparing >= 2 options across >= 3 dimensions
- Code blocks: minimal, runnable, with expected output when helpful
- Links: prefer canonical sources; don't paste long URLs inline unless in References

## Structure (Document Types)

Use Diátaxis categories to keep intent clean:
- **Tutorial**: learning path
- **How-to**: task completion steps
- **Reference**: precise facts/interfaces
- **Explanation**: concepts/why

Do not mix categories in one section. If needed, split.

## Agent Output Contract

When generating or editing artifacts, you MUST:
- Start with TL;DR bullets (unless the doc is pure reference)
- Apply the High-Entropy Rule sentence-by-sentence
- Convert vague statements into measurable criteria or delete them
- Surface constraints, assumptions, trade-offs, and failure modes explicitly
- Produce a final "Diff Summary" of what was removed/added and why (1–8 bullets)

You MUST NOT:
- Add motivational filler, obvious background, or generic best practices
- Repeat the prompt or restate headings as content
- Introduce new terminology without defining it once

## Quality Gates (Pre-Ship Checklist)

Before finalizing any document, verify:
- [ ] TL;DR exists and matches the body
- [ ] Every section answers: "What decision/action does this enable?"
- [ ] Requirements are testable (objective pass/fail)
- [ ] Assumptions are explicit; unknowns are tracked
- [ ] Alternatives considered; rejection reasons recorded
- [ ] Risks include mitigations and detection signals
- [ ] No duplicate ideas; no vague adjectives without numbers
- [ ] Links to code/data/runbooks exist where relevant

## Scoring Rubric (Quick Self-Audit)

Score 0–2 each:
- Signal density (no filler)
- Decision clarity (what to do, now)
- Testability (acceptance criteria)
- Explicit constraints/assumptions
- Failure modes covered
- Reproducibility (for research)

**Target:** >= 10/12 for publish; >= 8/12 for internal draft
